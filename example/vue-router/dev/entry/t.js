// In Webpack we can use special require syntax to signify a "split point"
// Webpack will automatically split and lazy-load the split modules.
// - https://webpack.github.io/docs/code-splitting.html

// Combine that with Vue's async components, we can easily make our route
// components lazy-loaded only when the given route is matched.

// async components are defined as:
// - resolve => resolve(Component)
// or
// - () => Promise<Component>

// For single component, we can use the AMD shorthand
// require(['dep'], dep => { ... })
const Foo = resolve => require(['../js/components/Foo.vue'], resolve)

// If using Webpack 2, you can also do:
// const Foo = () => System.import('./Foo.vue')

// If you want to group a number of components that belong to the same
// nested route in the same async chunk, you will need to use
// require.ensure. The 3rd argument is the chunk name they belong to -
// modules that belong to the same chunk should use the same chunk name.

const Baz = r => require.ensure([], () => r(require('../js/components/Baz.vue')), '/bar')

    // and grouped in the same async chunk.
